# Breaking Barriers
Breaking Barriers: Workforce Training Application built for Lifecycle Building Center by GT CS Junior Design Team 3110.

## User Flow

Our team chose to implement the user flow of having an administrator log in, click into the modules menu, and create a module.
This flow allows our team to test the chosen tech stack's ability to establish a front-end and back-end communication, as well as ensure the database can store and retrieve information.

For the current artifact implementation, the user flow is as follows:

The user will log into the system as an administrator. *(username: admin1, password: admin1)*

The user will then select the modules option in the main administrator menu.

The user will then click on the **"Create Module"** button.

The user will then fill out the appropriate fields to create the module.

Finally, the user will click on the "Create Module" button.

## Technology Stack

For the technology stack, our team chose the following technologies:

* Database: **PostgreSQL**
* Languages: **HTML/JS**
* Frameworks: **Express/Node.js, Bootstrap, React** (To be further implemented in Phase 2)
